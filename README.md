# node-in-browser
My first attempt to bootstrap Node.js in the browser in order to run Node apps or npm libraries unmodified.

## Quick Start
To check out the Node REPL in your browser, clone this repo, navigate to the cloned directory and run:


```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

This will server the REPL at http://localhost:8000/index.html
